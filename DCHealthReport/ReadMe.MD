Welcome to MultiDCDiag V 1.0! 

This script takes the DC list as an input and stores the result in an output folder.

The script has been prepared and tested in Powershell 4.0. So when you run this script, please make sure that the Powershell version is 4.0 or above.

While this script has been tested multiple times, I recommend that you test it in a test environment before using it in a production environment.

While every attempt has been made to make this script error free, I will not take any responsibilty for any consequence that would happen while running the script.
