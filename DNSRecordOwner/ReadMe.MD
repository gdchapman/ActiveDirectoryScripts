Using this Script, you can find the owner of multiple DNS records (Host & PTR) within few minutes.

During our test, we captured owner of 3500 host records within 5 minutes !

This script will only work for Active Directory Integrated DNS Zones.

If you want to set or remove ACL of multiple DNS records, please use my another script: Set and Remove DNS Records ACL
Use PowerShell 4.0 or higher.

This will not work out of box. You have to substitute few values based on your environment, which is mentioned within the script.

Test before you use.

Use at your own risk.
