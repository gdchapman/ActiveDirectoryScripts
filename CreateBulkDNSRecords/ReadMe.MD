Welcome to the PowerDNS V1.0 ! This is a one stop solution for all DNS related work.                   

Using this script , you can LookUp, Create and Delete A,PTR and CNAME Records.

The script has been prepared and tested in Powershell 4.0. So when you run this script, please make sure that the Powershell version is 4.0 or above.

This script is suitable for single record entry as well as bulk entry. For every operation there are two options, Single and Bulk. For Bulk entry you need to cretae an input file in CSV format. Sample input files has been provided along with this script.       While creating and deleting records, you will get a confirmation box for each record, to ensure that you are going to create or delete the correct record.

While this script has been tested multiple times, I recommend that you test it in a test environment before using it in a production environment.

While every attempt has been made to make this script error free, I will not take any responsibilty for any consequence that would happen while running the script.
