# ActiveDirectoryScripts
This Repository contains some useful PowerShell scripts related to Active Directory.

Active Directory is one of the most critical components in an IT Infrastructure. AD admins work hard to ensure the integrity and stability of the Active Directory environment. 

In this repository, you will find some useful scripts related to Active Directory. These scripts were originally published in PowerShell Gallery, and now I have copied these scripts to Github.

Use Powershell 4.0 or higer version.

Test before you use, and use at your own risk.
