# ActiveDirectoryScripts
This Repository contains some useful PowerShell scripts related to Active Directory and DNS.

These scripts were originally published on Microsoft TechNet Gallery, and now I have copied these scripts to Github.

Use Powershell 4.0 or higer version.

Test before you use, and use at your own risk.

The system where you will execute these scripts must have PowerShell Active Directory module installed.
